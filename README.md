# New York Taxi Analysis

This project predicts the fare amount passengers spend on yellow cab rides in specific regions of New York City. The predictions are based on temporal factors such as the hour, day, and month of the ride.

The project is a code-along adaptation of a tutorial by Misra Turp on YouTube, originally designed for January 2019 data. I have updated the analysis to use January 2024 data and implemented additional improvements, such as handling missing rows and refining the preprocessing steps.
